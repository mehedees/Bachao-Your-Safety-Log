# Bachao-Your-Safety-Log
Android App

Ever been in situations where you don't exactly feel safe but yet you don't want to alarm your closed ones because you are not sure? 
Bachao-Your Safety Log app lets you create a log in these situations where you can describe your situation with pictures and text notes and save it in the database. Your location will be automatically added to the log. Only you and your emergency contact(chosen by you) would be able to see this log. Whenever you create a log, your emergency contact will be notified through an sms. So they will always have a clue of what happened in case any danger befalls you. 
The app also has a "Bachao(Save Me)" feature. So if you are in danger you can activate it and it will start to send emergency messages containing your location to your emergency contact every 10 minutes. 
More features are yet to come. 
Stay connected with us. 
*Emergency messages and Log creation messages are sent from user's mobile phone and sms data may be charged for that. Sms verification messages will be sent by the app and user will not be charged for those.
